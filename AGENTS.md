# Project context

This repository is for an internal company dashboard (web app). It is used by employees to monitor operations, manage data, and access internal tools.

## Goals
- Provide fast access to key business metrics and status.
- Enable internal workflows (approvals, data updates, reporting).
- Keep the UI consistent with the company’s internal design system.

## Non-goals
- No public/consumer-facing features.
- No marketing or landing pages.
- No external user authentication flows.

## Users
- Internal staff only (operations, finance, support, leadership).

## Notes for contributors
- Prefer clarity and maintainability over cleverness.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase for UI and data access.
- Avoid adding public-facing features without alignment.
